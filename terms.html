          <br><br>

We require 10 clear working days' notice of cancellation or change of dates for any motorcycle courses, including restricted training courses and direct access courses.

All trainees attending any type of motorcycle training with Excelerate MTC and equipment belonging to Excelerate MTC are covered by our insurance. Excelerate MTC will not take any responsibility for any damage or loss of personal possessions or equipment belonging to the trainee whilst undergoing any training with us.
<br><br>
Should the trainee wish to use their own motorcycle, it will be their responsibility to ensure the bike they are using is road legal.
<br><br>
Compulsory Basic Training is usually one day of training, and our price reflects this. Should the trainee not meet the required standard, then further training will be offered and additional charges will apply. Further training will be offered at a time & date that is convenient to both Excelerate MTC and the trainee. The trainee will not be refunded if he/she does not meet the required standard on the day of the CBT.
<br><br>
Failure to arrive at the specified time will result in your CBT day being abandoned and any fees already paid will be lost.
<br><br>
On your CBT day, an eyesight test is required. If you wear/need contact lenses or glasses, please ensure you bring them on the day of your CBT. Failure to meet the minimum criteria could result in your training day being abandoned, and fees will be lost.
<br><br>
You will be required to read a number plate from a distance of 20 meters.
<br><br>
On the day of your CBT, you must bring/produce the ID card part of your provisional/full licence. Failure to do so will result in your CBT day being abandoned, and fees lost. Copies of your licence are not accepted.
<br><br>
Appropriate clothing must be worn at all times. We highly recommend wearing boots (not steel toe cap), motorcycle trousers or jeans, and long-sleeved tops. We are able to provide jackets, gloves, waterproofs, and helmets.
<br><br>
Excelerate reserve the right to refuse training to any person dressed inappropriately or any person who has consumed too much alcohol or any other illegal drugs the night before their training.
<br><br>
Excelerate MTC will not take responsibility for tests cancelled due to strike action by examiners or as a result of extreme/dangerous weather conditions. In extreme weather conditions, Excelerate reserve the right to postpone training, which will be moved to a later date. This is for the safety of candidates and instructors. We will not be held responsible for tests cancelled/changed by the DVSA due to a shortage of examiners or any other reasons given by them.
<br><br>
Excelerate MTC reserve the right to amend their terms & conditions to comply with the Driver Vehicle Standard Agency regulations and/or to continue to operate effectively without prior notice.
<br><br>
Any bookings can be moved to a different date (only once) free of charge. Any further changes will incur an admin fee of £20.00 each time. The maximum amount of times a course can be moved after the booking has been made is 2.
<br><br>
Refunds for DAS courses will incur an admin fee of £30.00.
<br><br>
Refunds for any other training will incur an admin fee of £20.00.
<br><br>
Any training attended cannot be refunded if, for any reason, the day has not been completed by the trainee due to their inability to continue for any reason and/or the instructor sees it appropriate at the time for the trainee’s own safety.
