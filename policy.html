          <br><br>
          Please take a moment to review our privacy policy and practices. Contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

<br><br>
Certain other information, like your driving license, needed to book tests with DVSA and for insurance purposes. We may also collect data about your health or medical conditions, where you have volunteered this, for example so that we can cater for you when you attend a course and keep you safe when engaging in activities with us. 
<br><br>

Your rights Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to: 
<br><br>
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
<br><br>
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
<br><br>
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
<br><br>
Request erasure of your personal data.
<br><br>
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
<br><br>
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
<br><br>
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
<br><br>
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. 
<br><br>
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
<br><br>
You can also withdraw your consent, where this is the basis for our processing your data (without affecting the lawfulness of our previous processing based on consent).
<br><br>
Request the transfer of your personal data to another party. Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled to refuse requests where exceptions apply.
<br><br>
